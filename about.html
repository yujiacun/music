        <p>MixRepo is a curated collection of electronic music mixes sourced from SoundCloud. It exists for one reason: discovery.</p>
        <p>The mixes are organised by series, each representing a label, podcast, or event that has consistently released quality mixes. Browse a specific series, explore them all, or hit Random and let the collection surprise you.</p>
        <p>Use the filter to narrow by group, or let the random selection pull from across the full catalogue. If something catches your ear, favourite it on SoundCloud and come back when you want something new.</p>
        <p>No accounts. No algorithms. No ads. Just mixes.</p>
        <p>The source is in the name.</p>
